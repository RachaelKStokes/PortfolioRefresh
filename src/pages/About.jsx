        My name is Rachael Stokes, I am a currently a coding bootcamp student about to graduate.  I am very interested in finding a career
        in this field and find it to be very enjoyable.  Most recently I have been learning REACT and MongoDB.  In my free time
        I enjoy gardening, hanging out with my family (including the furry ones!) and painting.
